The primary goal and impact of this research was to increase the environmental enrichment of a home thereby increasing the health and happiness of two kittens residing there. These kittens now have greater access to a safe and engaging non-static toy. This impact has a broad applicability and, with further work, has the capacity to impact and positively influence on the well-being of other cats as well.  
The market for robotic toys for entertaining pets is growing rapidly and a robot such as AFER meets many of the necessary requirements for a robotic pet toy and has the potential for monetization. Monetizing or selling the robot design to a commercial entity for mass production would allow other pet owners to provide a higher level of engagement to their pets as well. This would be particularly useful during crisis situations similar to COVID-19, as the pandemic caused an unprecedented increase in individuals fostering or adopting pets from animal shelters \cite{delgadillo_2020}. Therefore, a large number of first-time pet owners and individuals with multiple pets could highly benefit from having robotic toys like the one presented herein to assist with the enrichment and mental stimulation of their pets.
