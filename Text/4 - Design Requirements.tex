Given the intended use of the AFER platform, the design could not be overly complex and could not require components that would be difficult to acquire for the average person. The robot required the ability to move a cat toy end effector in several, distinct movement patterns for maximum engagement with the animals. 
The robot design also needed adequate safety precautions integrated into the design to prevent injury during operations. The joints and linkages needed adequate softness to prevent injury in the event that the robot made contact with an animal during the course of operations, and any components relating to the control such as wires would be designed such that the animals will not be able to access them.
